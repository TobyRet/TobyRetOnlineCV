				<p>In 2011 I was seconded to lead a cross departmental team on the creation of a new online community for music education professionals.</p>

				<p>Built on the Drupal platform, the <a href="http://network.youthmusic.org.uk">Youth Music Network</a> has more than 6,000 members. 80% of the content is created by the community allowing the sharing of a wealth of expertise and know-how between professionals. Ongoing development is 'agile' and done in close consultation with users.</p>

				<p>My success with the Youth Music Network lead to me being invited to speak about 'building online communities' at the <a href="http://www.charitycomms.org.uk">Charity Comms Digital Impact Conference </a>in 2013.</p>

				<p>In 2013 I took the lead on Youth Music's first re-branding exercise. Youth Music had been through a lot of organisational change and needed to do more to engage supporters.</p>

				<p>Working with <a href="http://www.audiencecommunications.com/">Audience Communications</a> I helped create a revised vision, mission and values for the Charity before creating a new visual identity with the help of <a href="www.mcsaatchi.com/london">M&amp;C Saatchi</a>.</p>

				<p>Outputs included brand guidelines, new <a href="http://www.youthmusic.org.uk">supporter website</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/youthmusic">re-skinned social media</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4mt8K_xzcQ">showreel video</a> and staff resources. The launch of the brand was met with great acclaim at a sold out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJTs91K9EYw">Breakfast Seminar</a> streamed live on the web. In Aug this year, a successful bid was made to the postcode lottery for Â£100k which was directly attributed to the re-brand.</p>

				<p>The website you are reading now first went live in July 2013 and was hand-coded using simple HTML5/CSS3 design.</p>

				<p>After taking Mattan Griffel's <a href="https://onemonthrails.com">'One Month Rails'</a> course I rebuilt the site in October 2013 using Ruby on Rails and Twitter Bootstrap. I also created a <a href="http://safe-oasis-6895.herokuapp.com/">clone of Pinterest</a>.</p>

				<p>I plan to keep improving the site over the coming months as well as broadening my technical expertise in other areas, particularly, the Ruby programming language. I would love to hear any feedback you may have on my website. <a href="mailto:toby.retallick@gmail.com">Please drop me a line!</a></p>
